# ðŸš€ Ambulaunch-Beta Release Repo

Welcome to the Ambulaunch Beta Release Repository! Ambulaunch is an easy-to-use, supercharged launcher designed specifically for AMBOSS' Educational & Clinician Platform. This tool is engineered to enhance efficiency by providing seamless access to a broad range of medical and educational resources with minimal distraction.

## Key Functionality

### BFSB (Big Fat Search Box)
- **Instant Access with Hotkey**: Simply press `CMD + J` (Mac) or `Ctrl + J` (Windows) to instantly bring up the BFSB. This non-distracting search box is always at your fingertips, ready to assist with your queries. Once activated, the search dashboard appears, conveniently pre-populated with your entered term, allowing for immediate and efficient search operations.

### Additional Features/Roadmap
- **Customized Suggestions**: Ambulaunch is not just a search tool; it suggests tailored searches and content deeplinks, targeting specific specialties or areas of interest.
- **Related Answers**: Beyond just finding resources, it offers relevant answers and resources based on the context of your query.
- **Smart Assistant Capabilities**: It functions as a smart assistant, providing quick commands for common tasks. Examples include:
